 Current count-based differential expression tools are poorly suited to differential expression analysis 
 in genomes with alternatively spliced genes. 

 The main reason for this is that when a gene has multiple isoforms, 
 a change in the total number of reads or fragments from that gene doesn't 
 always correspond to a change in expression for that gene. 

 Conversely, a gene's expression may change, but the total number of 
 fragments generated by its isoforms may be very similar.

 What is the difference between gene level and isoform level expression values? 



gene level expression values are derived from sequenced fragments that are mapped to a gene. 

While isoform level expression values are derived from sequenced fragments that could be mapped to a given isoform of a gene.

This is complicated by the fact that fragments of a given gene are often shared by many splice variant, and therfore can't, in general, be assigned to a single isoform.




 When could gene levels expression values be misleading?

The cufflinks FAQ does a good job of explaning this: 

 "... when a gene has multiple isoforms, 
 a change in the total number of reads or fragments from that gene doesn't 
 always correspond to a change in expression for that gene. 

 Conversely, a gene's expression may change, but the total number of 
 fragments generated by its isoforms may be very similar"


Basically, that this is saying is that one needs to understand the expression of a gene 
with in the context of isoform(s) that it gives rise to. 



when one wants to understand the expression of a gene 
they need 


Most differential expression packages count reads at a gene level and look for differences in these counts directly. However, this approach can be very inaccurate for genes that have multiple isoforms, because a change in relative abundance of the isoforms can change overall gene abundance without generating a large change in the number of reads from that gene. Conversely, a change in overall gene counts does not necessarily imply a similar fold-change in gene expression. For
